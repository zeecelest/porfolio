                <p>I am a web developer and recent graduate of the 
                    Engineering Immersion Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. I enjoy 
                    the complexity of coding, as well as the ability to be innovative. 
                    As a creative person, coding allows me to manifest ideas in fun and 
                    exciting ways. Coding is always evolving and developers like myself 
                    are at the forefront of this technical revolution. I am looking forward 
                    to working with an amazing team of programmers to lead the way to new 
                    software innovations.
                </p>
                {/* <br> */}
                <p>When Iâ€™m not coding you will usually find me
                    sitting behind a blank canvas with a paint brush in my hand.  
                    Arts is a passion of mine that allows me to recreate 
                    the reality around me. I love spending time with my sons, dogs, 
                    friends and family whenever I can tear myself away from my computer.
